Parrot is a (very) small Swift framework that helps with advertising an iOS device as an iBeacon as well as monitoring/ranging for iBeacons.

### ðŸŽ™ Broadcasting an iBeacon Signal

Parrot allows you to [turn your device into an iBeacon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/turning_an_ios_device_into_an_ibeacon) by doing the following:

```swift
let uuid = UUID(string: "E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F")!
let beaconAdvertiser = BeaconAdvertiser(uuid: uuid, identifier: "com.myCompany.BeaconIdentifier", params: .none)
beaconAdvertiser.startAdvertising { advertiser, state in 
  print("State: \(state) for \(advertiser)")
}
```

### ðŸ”Š Determining the Proximity to an iBeacon

Parrot also allows you to very easily [determine the proximity to an iBeacon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/determining_the_proximity_to_an_ibeacon) by doing the following:

```swift
let uuid = UUID(string: "E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F")!
let beaconMonitor = BeaconMonitor(uuid: uuid, identifier: "com.myCompany.BeaconIdentifier", params: .none)
beaconMonitor.startMonitoring(
  onProximityUpdate: { monitor, proximity in
    print("Proximity: \(proximity) for \(monitor)")
  },
  onError: { error in
    print("Error occured: \(error)")       
  }
)
```

### ðŸ“š Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first. If you'd like to advertise and monitor, you'll two devices.

### ðŸ›  Installation

Parrot is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "Parrot"
```

Parrot is also available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Add this to your Cartfile:

```
github "carrot-ar/Parrot"
```
